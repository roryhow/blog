# Notes to self
## What are we trying to talk about here?
- We gave a workshop for mimmitkoodaa, teaching them to how to code with html and css, and showing this how these skills can be used practically by creating a custom shopify component.
- In this talk we keep any technical terminology to a minimum, as it does a great job of scaring off newcomers to tech.
- We also really emphasised the fact that _none_ of us really know what we're doing, and we resort to google on a daily (hourly?) basis. This is totally fine.
- Finally, we wanted to push curiosity within our participants. Encourange them to ask questions, get them to think about how their favourite websites work under the hood. Curiosity helps break down this illusion that development is a technical task that should be left only to certain professional.


# Getting Women Into Tech: Notes and Learnings

## What did we do?
[Mimmitkoodaa](https://mimmitkoodaa.ohjelmistoebusiness.fi/in-english/) is an organisation based in Finland that aims to provide free training to women who are interested in programming. The need for this is clear - it's no secret that there is an incredible gender imbalance in the tech industry, and for this reason it becomes necessary to provide as much of a helping hand as possible in order to facilitate womens' path into tech. There's no near-horizon benefit doing this from a business perspective - we don't going into such events with a recruitment focus, we're not selling a product to potential clients, and I could probably have used this time to make more money for my company elsewhere. But, this highlights the fact that Futurice and Columbia Road both have a vested interest in improving the communities that helped us get where we are. We are all responsible for improving our environments, and that's what makes it special for me to get involved in such events.

## From zero to HTML, CSS and Shopify ready in one day
We started the day with the assumption that our participants knew absolutely nothing about web development, so this meant that our promise for the day was quite a considerable one: How is it possible to teach two very different languages (each of which being a product of tens of years of iteration and refinement), _and_ a platform where they can be integrated together in a day? The answer is deceptively simple (and also makes for a great clickbait headline).

**You don't have to _actually_ teach the content. Just let people follow your lead and give them the courage to continue learning in their own time. It's that simple.**

If we were to give a pop quiz at the end of the workshop on the days content, I'm sure many of the participants would score very little. This is totally fine, and we actually aim for this! There is no expectation for the knowledge of HTML elements and CSS properties to be immediately carved into your long-term memory at the first time of asking. The most important aspect of this is ensuring that participants are able to follow along, while understanding the reasoning behind each change that is made in the code.

After this is considered, it's not actually that important to give a step-by-step run-down what was taught on the day. We told our participants details such as what HTML element attributes are, and how to make a CSS query elector for an element by class name, amongst other things. But, with each step that we took, our audience reciprocated, and we made sure that noone was left behind.

## Ego-stroking phrases don't generate value - you do
I'll say this upfront: the tech industry (particularly the more academic ares) have a fantastic affinity with overcomplicating relatively simple concepts by throwing ridiculous arbitrary terminology everywhere. It's simply not necessary, and it often serves as a barrier to those wanting to get involved in tech. With this in mind, we set out to teach the basics of HTML and CSS in the most buzzword-free means possible.

What does HTML/CSS stand for? Let me tell you a secret:

**Nobody really gives a shit.**

These points (to me) are so important to drive home, especially to newcomers. It doesn't matter what concrete definitions you're able to recite, what matters is the value that you create. Everything else is just a way to make it sound like you _really_ know what you're talking about.

## None of us know what we're doing and _that's ok_


## Be curious, ask questions
There seems to be a level of 

## Giving tech presentations is standup comedy for nerds
I had the pleasure of watching Richard Feldman give a talk at ClojuTRE earlier this year titled ["Why Isn't Functional Programming the Norm?"](https://youtu.be/QyJZzq0v7Z4)
