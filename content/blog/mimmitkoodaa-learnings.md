# Getting women into tech: notes and learnings

## What happened?
[Mimmitkoodaa](https://mimmitkoodaa.ohjelmistoebusiness.fi/in-english/) is an organisation based in Finland that aims to provide free training to women who are interested in programming. The need for this is clear - there is an incredible gender imbalance in the tech industry, and for this reason it becomes necessary to provide as much of a helping hand as possible in order to facilitate womens path into tech.

The company that I work for, Futurice, and it's digital-growth focused subsidiary, Columbia Road, have taken the intiative to host workshops for such women, and I volunteered to help out. I'll be the first to admit that being a white male from a comfortable corner of Oxfordshire with questionable Finnish skills, I'm perhaps the least qualified person to be facilitating such a workshop. Regardless, I was excited to help out and spread the word of actually how _easy_ working in the tech industry actually is.
