## Hi there! My name is Rory.

I'm a software developer from the UK, currently living in Finland, working at [Futurice](https://www.futurice.com) and studying for a Computer Science Masters at [Aalto University](https://aalto.fi). You can find out a little bit more about me by looking at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roryhow/). Or, if you'd like to look at some of the projects that I work on you can check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/roryhow). I also ramble occasionally on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/roryhow).

If you want to contact me, you can do so by filling in the below form (you don't need to give me a real address but if you want me to get back to you I'd recommend it), or you can email me directly at my email - contact[at]rory.how
