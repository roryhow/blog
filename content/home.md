## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Rory.

I'm a software developer from Oxford, England, currently living in Helsinki, Finland. Right now I'm working at [Columbia Road](https://www.columbiaroad.com), a digital sales tech consultancy, where I work as a managed services lead. In practice this means that I'm responsible for the Care & Maintenance operations in Columbia Road, which manifests itself as a broad spectrum of responsibilities - ranging from active software development of existing services for our clients, to operations and management within the consultancy. I have a Computer Science Masters at [Aalto University](https://aalto.fi), and a Computer Science Bachelors at [Swansea University](https://swansea.ac.uk). You can find out a little bit more about me by looking at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roryhow/). Or, if you'd like to look at some of the projects that I work on you can check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/roryhow). I also ramble occasionally on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/roryhow).

If you want to get in touch, please feel free to throw me an email at [me@rory.how](mailto:me@rory.how).
