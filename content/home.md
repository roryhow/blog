## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Rory.

I'm a software developer from Oxford, UK, currently living in Finland. Right now I'm working at [Futurice](https://www.futurice.com) and in the last stages (I promise) of a Computer Science Masters at [Aalto University](https://aalto.fi). You can find out a little bit more about me by looking at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roryhow/). Or, if you'd like to look at some of the projects that I work on you can check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/roryhow). I also ramble occasionally on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/roryhow).

If you want to get in touch, please feel free to throw me an email at [me[at]rory.how](mailto:me@rory.how).
